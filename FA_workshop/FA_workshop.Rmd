```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(learnr)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, comment=NA, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE, R.options=list(width=120), 
                      cache.rebuild=F, cache=F,
                      fig.align='center', dev = 'svg', dev.args=list(bg = 'transparent'), exercise.lines = 5)
```


## PCA

Let's start

```{r pca, exercise=TRUE}
library(psych)
```

### Exercise with Code




## Common Factor Analysis

Use the fa function to conduct a factor analysis


```{r fa, exercise=TRUE}

```
```{r fa-hint}
psych::fa(mtcars, nfactors = 1)
psych::fa(mtcars, nfactors = 2)
psych::fa(mtcars, nfactors = 3)
```

### Exercise with Hint

*Here's an exercise where the chunk is pre-evaulated via the `exercise.eval` option (so the user can see the default output we'd like them to customize). We also add a "hint" to the correct solution via the chunk immediate below labeled `print-limit-hint`.*

Modify the following code to limit the number of rows printed to 5:

```{r print-limit, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
mtcars
```

```{r print-limit-hint}
head(mtcars)
```

### Quiz

*You can include any number of single or multiple choice questions as a quiz. Use the `question` function to define a question and the `quiz` function for grouping multiple questions together.*

Some questions to verify that you understand the purposes of various base and recommended R packages:

```{r quiz}
quiz(
  question("Which package contains functions for installing other R packages?",
    answer("base"),
    answer("tools"),
    answer("utils", correct = TRUE),
    answer("codetools")
  ),
  question("Which of the R packages listed below are used to create plots?",
    answer("lattice", correct = TRUE),
    answer("tools"),
    answer("stats"),
    answer("grid", correct = TRUE)
  )
)
```
